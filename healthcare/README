Overview

This project contains files used in the O’Reilly Media Learning Path training video entitled Using Data Science for Business Model Innovation. In the project are two R scripts:
•	simSmartCity.R which requires household_power_consumption.csv
•	simSmartCitystrategy.R which requires iot.businessmodel.csv

The smartcity.businessmodel.csv file

The smartcity.businessmodel.csv file was created by a business model simulation algorithm. The algorithm’s design is described in this blog:
https://blogs.csc.com/2015/04/29/a-prototype-business-model-simulator/

 The following is a description of fields contained in the iot.businessmodel.csv file:
•	cns1, cns2: current consumers (millions) for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0-100
•	pcn1, pcn2: potential consumers (millions) for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0-100
•	inv1, inv2: coefficient of innovation for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0.01-0.10
•	imt1, imt2: coefficient of imitation for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0.1-1.0
•	ped1, ped2: price elasticity of demand for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0.5-1.5
•	oe1, oe2: output elasticity for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0-1
•	cpex1, cpex2: initial capital investment (in $millions) for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0-100
•	pro1, pro2: days required to make a working prototype for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 14-1000
•	ikp1, ikp2: improvement rate of key partners for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0.1-0.9
Special modifications to the business model

The strategy is modeled after the long-tail platform pattern. The idea is to use consumer-grade communication technology to allow patients to interact with nurses and doctors. this allows hospitals to provide personalized care to a large population of patients. We model the strategy with the assumption of high returns to scale and large customer potential. We selected only those records where oe2 > 0.7 and pcn2 > 75
