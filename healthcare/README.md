# Simulating People: How to Build Better Healthcare

## Overview
What if a hospital were willing to make comprehensive changes in how it treats and interacts with patients? Could a hospital improve the quality of patient care by changing its operations? This project contains files used in the O’Reilly Media Learning Path training video entitled Using Data Science for Business Model Innovation. In the project are two R scripts:

1. `sim Healthcare.R` which requires `data.health.csv`
2. `sim Hospital strategy.R` which requires `hospital.businessmodel.csv`

Start by running `sim Healthcare.R`. We start by collecting real observations of hospital patient experiences. We search for opportunities improve the quality of care. We use real observations to generate simulated hospitals and patient care experiences. We test the plausibility of the simulations by comparing them to real observations. We search the simulated patient experiences for interesting patterns of high-quality care. We look for clusters of hospitals that have found some unusual, but significant way of improving a patient's experience. 

Next, run `sim Hospital strategy.R`. After finding an innovative way of improving a patient's experience, we search through business model simulations for an equally innovative way to make the idea profitable.

## Simulating the Business Model

The `healthcare.businessmodel.csv` file was created based on a business model simulation algorithm. The algorithm’s design is described in the [A Prototype Business Model Simulator](https://blogs.csc.com/2015/04/29/a-prototype-business-model-simulator/) blog. The business model is patterned after the *long-tail platform* pattern. The idea is to use consumer-grade communication technology to allow patients to interact with nurses and doctors. this allows hospitals to provide personalized care to a large population of patients. We model the strategy with the assumption of high returns to scale and large customer potential. We selected only those records where `oe2 > 0.7` and `pcn2 > 75`. The `healthcare.businessmodel.csv` file was generated by the following *R* code:

```R
#read the universe of simulated business models
models <- read.csv("sim1.csv")

#select a subset of the models that corresponds to the strategy of
#using consumer communication technology for patient-nurse communication

#the strategy is modeled after the long-tail platform pattern. the idea
#is to use consumer-grade communication technology to allow patients to
#interact with nurses and doctors. this allows hospitals to provide
#personalized care to a large population of patients. we model the strategy
#with the assumption of high returns to scale and large patient potential

businessmodel <- models[models$oe2 > .7,]
businessmodel <- businessmodel[businessmodel$pcn2 > 75,]

#remove the unnecessary id column
businessmodel$X <- NULL

#store the strategy file for subsequent analysis
write.csv(businessmodel, file="hospital.businessmodel.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

The following is a description of fields contained in the `financial.institute.businessmodel.csv` file:
