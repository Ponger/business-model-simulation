Overview
This project contains files used in the O’Reilly Media Learning Path training video entitled Using Data Science for Business Model Innovation. In the project are two R scripts:
•	simIoT.R which requires household_power_consumption.csv
•	simIoTstrategy.R which requires iot.businessmodel.csv

The iot.businessmodel.csv file
The iot.businessmodel.csv file was created by a business model simulation algorithm. The algorithm’s design is described in this blog. The following is a description of fields contained in the iot.businessmodel.csv file:
cns1, cns2: current consumers (millions) for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0-100
pcn1, pcn2: potential consumers (millions) for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0-100
inv1, inv2: coefficient of innovation for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0.01-0.10
imt1, imt2: coefficient of imitation for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0.1-1.0
ped1, ped2: price elasticity of demand for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0.5-1.5
oe1, oe2: output elasticity for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0-1
cpex1, cpex2: initial capital investment (in $millions) for the competitor’s business model and our business model innovation respectively. Range: 0-100
